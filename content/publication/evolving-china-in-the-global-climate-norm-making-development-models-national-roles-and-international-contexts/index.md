  As the world’s second largest economy and largest emitter of greenhouse gases,
  China’s participation in global climate governance has gained worldwide
  attention and has been under closer international scrutiny. This paper aims to
  understand China’s motivations and underlying forces that have driven its
  positions, practices and choices in this regard, particularly when negotiating
  and complying with the UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement. For this
  end, the article focuses on the changes and continuities of China in the
  evolving international climate norm-making. I argue that China’s roles and
  engagement in the processes have been fundamentally shaped by development
  patterns, perception of national roles, and international contexts. The paper
  concludes that based on social, political and economic conditions, a mutual
  understanding and learning between China and other countries can reveal
  insights on global governance in the future.
