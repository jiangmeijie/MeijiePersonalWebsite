abstract: "With the rise of BRICS countries, more scholarly production has
  emerged arguing that emerging economies are now playing significant
  norm-making or norm-shaping roles in world politics. However, there is still a
  gap in the existing literature about how rising powers promote alternative
  ideas, rules, and norms in an increasingly complex normative environment. In
  this paper, I will contribute to this debate by drawing on Daniel Flemes’s
  typology of foreign policy networks: mediation, advocacy, and substitution
  networks. From a network perspective, this paper focuses particularly on the
  Chinese strategy in accepting and shaping norms and rules within the different
  foreign policy networks in three issue areas: security, climate change, and
  economic cooperation. The study shows that various foreign policy networks are
  able to consolidate emerging powers’ roles as norm-makers in the international
  system while guaranteeing maximum flexibility. In addition, China plays a more
  prominent role in low politics such as the economic and financial areas where
  foreign policy networks have greater formalization, while in contrast, in high
  politics such as security and humanitarianism, China is less influential and
  involved in informal and flexible foreign policy networks."
