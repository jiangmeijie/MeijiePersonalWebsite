  Over the past decades, China has significantly enhanced its national strength
  and has arisen as the second-largest economy in the world. Meanwhile, Beijing
  has become enthusiastic about developing South-South relations through
  bilateral and multilateral mechanisms. This paper looks into the changes and
  continuities of Sino-Latin American relations to observe Chinese strategic
  calculations and motivations behind China´s engagement with the Global South.
  The main findings are: first, the bilateral relations shifted from ideological
  indifference to economic engagement after China´s Reform and Opening up;
  second, the commodities boom in the 2000s made China a major trade, investing,
  and lending partner of Latin America and helped the region sustain its growth
  even after the 2008 economic crisis; third, China offers alternative
  development cooperation, which is different from Washington Consensus; forth,
  the current pandemic poses both challenges and opportunities for Sino-Latin
  American relations in the future.
