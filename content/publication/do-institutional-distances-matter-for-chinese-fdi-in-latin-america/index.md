  Along with the presence of the Global South as a relevant actor and global
  force, the world has become increasingly complex and heterogeneous. This paper
  focuses on the burgeoning economic cooperation between the largest emerging
  economy, China, and an increasingly important region, Latin America. Since
  China’s presence in Latin America, there have been ongoing debates on what
  drives Chinese investments in the region. Yet, there is little consensus
  regarding the impact of institutional distances on investment flows among
  developing countries. Using panel data for Chinese FDI stock in 33 Latin
  American countries between 1996 and 2018, the empirical study applies an
  extended gravity model to test whether institutional distances, measured by
  the Worldwide Governance Indicators, the Index of Economic Freedom, and
  Hofstede’s national culture dimensions, foster or hinder Chinese investment in
  the region. The findings challenge the conventional wisdom that like-minded
  countries in political and economic systems have larger investment flows. I
  find that Chinese investors are indifferent to political and economic
  differences when casting outward investment in Latin America. In terms of
  culture, China prefers to invest in culturally similar Latin countries to
  avoid uncertainty in host countries. The empirical results suggest China has
  been exploring new ways of cooperation, with alternative approaches and logic.
  A better understanding of this topic will shed more light on the strategic
  considerations behind China's ever-expanding economic power and influence as
  well as China ́s impact on both Global South and the world.
