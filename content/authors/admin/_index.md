My name is Meijie (pronunciation \[‘mei’dʒie]). Remember there is an E at the end (Don’t confuse it with Japanese dynasty Meiji). I obtained my doctoral degree with international mention at Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona. As a member of the research group on Public International Law and International Relations of Law Department, my research interests include China-Latin America relations, international relations, foreign policy, political discourse, media, etc. I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Spanish language and literature from Sun Yat-sen University (China) in 2014 and my Master Degree in Latin American international relations from Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (Spain) in 2017. I am also a lecturer in the Department of Humanities, responsibles for subjects of the Master Program in Asia-Pacific Studies.
