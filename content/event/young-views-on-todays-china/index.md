title: Young views on today's China
abstract: How do young people see China? What are their perceptions and
  expectations vis-à-vis the Asian superpower? What do they make of Xi Jinping’s
  China image on issues like democracy, human rights, Hong Kong or Taiwan? On
  Friday 4 June, at 11 AM (CEST), Pablo Pareja, coordinator of IDEES’ magazine
  special issue on China, will moderate a conversation with three young
  researchers who have lived and studied in China for the last 10 years. Pareja
  will ask them about their perceptions of contemporary China, the
  transformations of the political system, the changes in the Higher Education
  model or the role of women in Chinese society. The conversation, jointly
  organized with the Institut Barcelona Estudis Internacionals (IBEI), is part
  of the monographic issue "China Before a World in Crisis".
