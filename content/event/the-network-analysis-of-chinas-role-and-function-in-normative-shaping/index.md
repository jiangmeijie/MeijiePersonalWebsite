title: The network analysis of China's role and function in normative shaping
abstract: >-
  The fourth session of the AEPDIRI Seminars on current issues in International
  Relations, organized within the framework of the Jean Monnet Project that was
  granted to AEPDIRI (EUGLOBAL), proposes a reflection and academic debate on
  the role of different regions in the processes construction of global
  standards, with special attention to the European Union and the so-called
  BRICS. 


  During the event, I made a presentation on a network analysis of China´s role and function in normative shaping. The main findings are: (1) Network powers consolidate roles as important players in the international system while guaranteeing maximum flexibility. (2) The network strategy shows Beijing´s increasing willingness and efforts to construct its identity as a normative power. China is able to assert its own normative preference along with like-minded countries. (3) China plays a more prominent role in low politics such as the economic and financial areas where foreign policy networks have greater formalization while in high politics such as security and humanitarianism, China is less influential and involved in informal and flexible foreign policy networks.
