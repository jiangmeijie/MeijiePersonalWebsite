title: Do institutional distances matter for Chinese FDI in Latin America?
abstract: "I created an analytical framework integrating political, economic and
  cultural factors to elucidate how intangible factors impact economic relations
  between China and Latin America. This will help rethink the conventional
  thought that smaller institutional distances will attract more investment and
  understand China's expanding economic power and influence and its implications
  on both Global South and the world. The main findings are: (1) Chinese
  investors are indifferent to political and economic differences; (2) cultural
  distance is significantly and negatively correlated with China's OFDI; (3) the
  indicators imply the potential struggle for concept definition as well as
  validity and reliability of the data."
